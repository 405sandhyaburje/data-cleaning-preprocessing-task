## 📌 Objective
Clean and preprocess a raw dataset containing nulls, duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and text issues using Excel.

## ✅ Steps Performed

- Removed duplicate rows using Excel’s **"Remove Duplicates"** on all columns to avoid repeated records.
- Fixed `"###"` display issues by **auto-resizing columns** to show hidden data values.
- Filtered and deleted rows with **blank or missing values** across key columns like `gender`, `age`, `category`, `price`, etc.
- Added a new column: **`total_amount = quantity * price`**.
- Verified and corrected **data types**:
  - `age`, `quantity` as integers  
  - `price` as float where necessary.
